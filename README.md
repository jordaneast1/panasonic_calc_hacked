# panasonic_calc_hacked
Hacked version of the panasonic Throw Distance Calculator that allows for out-of-spec curved screens.

DISCLAIMERS 
- this was altered using Claude code. I can't read minimized javascript very well
- take all measurments with an ocean of salt. I was mostly testing a single projector/lens set-up in Ceiling orientation mode
- curved radius should be greater than or equal to the room width/2
- original files downloaded on 6/11/2025 -  proj specs may have changed
